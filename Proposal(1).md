Hey Raz and Steven, my formal proposal is bellow as well as the link to the repository. I had a bit of an issue with the API fetching. Please take a look at the Javascript in the repository. Have a goodnight


Lately I've been gambiling on US sports via Draftkings, with pocket change. The more i gamble, the more information i try to look for before i make a decision on any of the plays i want to make. After gaining some experience, i noticed that there are statistics for individual players that are likely to make you some profit. All these statistics can be found in various places, but some aren't calculated in the way that I've been able to profit from. For example, a pitchers (baseball) strike out average is something you canâ€™t easily find, what you can find is a pitcher's overall yearly strikeouts, or overall career strikeouts. This is where the light-bulb turned on... What if there was an app that allowed you to see all these types of statistics in regards to games being played in the present day. Ideally I am aiming for up to 3-5 days ahead, but for the sake of time I'd like to start with the present day. I believe some of these stats can be pulled from https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php. Of course I'll have to write some code for specific statistics like the one mentioned above. This could be presented as a profit gainer, which can easily be marketed.
