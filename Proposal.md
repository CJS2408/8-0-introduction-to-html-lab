Latley i've been gambiling on US sports via Draftkings, with pocket change. The more i gamble, the more information i try to look for before i make a decision on any of the plays i want to make. After gaining some experience, i noticed that there are statistics for individual players that are likely to make you some profit. All these stastics can be found in various places, but some aren't calculated in the way that i've been able to profit. For example, a pitchers (baseball) strike out average is something you can easily find, what you can find is a pitchers over all yearly strikes, or overall career strikes. This is where the light-bulb turned on, what if there was an app that allowed you to see all these type of stastics in regards to games being played in the present day. Ideallyt i am aiming for up to 3-5 days ahaead, but for the sake of time i'd like to start with the present day. I believe some of these stats can be pulled from https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php. Of course i'll have to write some code for specific states like the one metioned above. This could be presented as a profit gainer, which can easily be marketed.
